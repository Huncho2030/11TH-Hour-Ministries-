                At 11TH Hour Ministries, we passionately emphasize the importance of worshiping the CREATOR and living with reverence to God.
                Based in Nairobi, we expose the deceptions of spiritual Babylon and the errors propagated by apostate churches.
                Our mission is to call people out of false systems and warn against the worship of the beast and its image. 
                We empower believers through Bible study, revealing the truths necessary for these end times and preparing hearts for the imminent return of Jesus Christ.
