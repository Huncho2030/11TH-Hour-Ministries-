                <h5>WORSHIP GATHERINGS</h5>
                <p>
                    At 11TH Hour Ministries, we invite you to engage in transformative worship gatherings that draw you closer to the Creator.
                    These sessions are designed to foster a deep connection with God, allowing you to express your faith through music, prayer, and community.
                    Each gathering emphasizes the importance of recognizing His judgment hour and living a life of reverence.
                    Come and witness the power of collective worship as we stand firm against the deceptions of spiritual Babylon,
                    reinforcing our commitment to Godâ€™s commandments and the teachings of Jesus.
                    Experience the joy of uniting in faith.
